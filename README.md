Description:

Project Title - Land Feature Classification In Satellite Images Using Neural Networks

Summary: 
    The increasing use of remote sensing technology has made high-resolution satellite images readily available, which can aid in understanding changes in land use and cover, including vegetation assessment, industrial development, and new settlement zones. With the advancements in deep learning and neural network methods, the tedious task of change detection and classification of both structured and unstructured data can be automated. 
    
    The purpose of this study is to utilize a neural network algorithm to classify satellite images based on their land cover features, such as annual crops, forest, industrial areas, and sea. Specifically, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of the DenseNet-121 deep neural network in extracting feature information from EuroSAT and LandSAT images. By applying neural network classification models, we will analyze and visualize the land cover information embedded in the images, with the goal of demonstrating the potential of using DenseNet-121 for future satellite image classification applications in remote sensing.
